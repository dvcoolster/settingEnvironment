File structure is pretty robust as per setting environment in PluralSight :P

Thoda jyada senti ho gaya main :P

$ npm intall
$ npm start -s

I guess above command should setup the environment for you as well. Can you please
fork this, and help me fix this bug!

This is a sync/async problem, line 10 in index.js runs on the array result.
But, result is not returned, infact, the command before getUsers is also I believe not
called, this much I could figure out from looking at console in Chrome. Don't waste a lot
of time on this, but thoda discuss karte hai is pure flow ke baare main on setup.
Thoda discuss karenge toh shayad mujhe yaad better rahega :) Thanks bro
